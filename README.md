Accurate prediction of stock market returns is a very challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of the financial stock markets. With the introduction of machine learning, time series forecasting and increased computational capabilities, programmed methodsof prediction have proved to be more efficient in predicting stock prices. • In this work, regression and time series forecasting techniques have been utilized for predicting the next day closing price for one company belonging to the Finance sector of operation. • The financial data: Open, High, Low and Close prices of stock are used for creating new variables which are used as inputs to the model. • The models are evaluated using standard strategic indicators: RMSE and MAPE. • The low values of these two indicators show that the models are efficient in predicting stock closing prices.
